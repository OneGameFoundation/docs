### Version Management
--------------------

In One Game’s mining process, anyone can become a miner without any permission, which means, miners have the freedom to host different versions of the service, and they can provide forked ones improved by open source contributions.

However, to prevent possible security concerns and to protect the system from potential security hazards, on one hand, we record and register all the binaries’ fingerprints in the Miner’s Registration Center; on the other hand, a voting process is designed, such that game developers and game players can form a committee and decide which open source version is the elected version. The theory of the voting process is explained in detail in section 4. 

The computing platform of Deepbrain Chain, also guarantees that once a version is deployed, it will be kept in a sandbox safely and will not be modified by any external programs or actors.
