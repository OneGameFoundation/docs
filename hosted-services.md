### Hosted Services
--------------------

In the simulated mining process, miners deploy various services to Deepbrain Chain’s computing platform:

- Main Server, includes fundamental components of the system, for example, game lobby, asset store, scenes.
- AI Algorithms, include algorithms for pathfinding, and the behavior and decision making of the NPCs. 
- Numeric Computing, manages game physics and collision detection. 
- Scripting Engine, compiles and executes scripts created by developers. 

When the client side needs to send requests to the server side, it first looks up for the corresponding service’s IP address from Miner’s Registration Center, and then sets up a peer-to-peer connection with the service. 

When the requests from the client side exceeds the capacity of the existing miners, the Incentive Program will raise the mining rewards to attract more miners. On the contrary, when there are not enough requests, the Incentive Program will lower the mining rewards, which will decrease of number of miners, to save energy.
