### Developer Tools
--------------------

Game creation in the One Game platform will be facilitated through the following developer tools:
- Land Editor: alters the landâ€™s topographical appearance, such elevation and landscaping.
- Assets Editor: creates and modifies non-avatar game assets.
- Avatar Editor: creates and modifies avatars features, behaviors and genetics makeup.
- Scripts Editor: edits scripts, in order to control properties and events related to land, assets, or tasks.

Our goal is to enable new developers with little or no experience to easily make great games using easy to use interface, as well as provide advanced options to allow professional game developers to be creative and to make the best use of the One Game platform.
