### Scripts
-----------------------------

**What scripts can you use?**
Developers can use scripts to override the default physical
rules in the One Game platform, create own plots or stories, make None Player Characters (NPCs) come alive through AI algorithms, or define the starting and ending conditions of their games on their land.

**Can developers make their scripts?**
Yes, we will open source scripts and we will allow developers to write embeddable Lua scripts which can extend or modify our open source scripts or write these scripts entirely from scratch.
