### Glossary
------------

**dAPP**
Short for decentralized application, a dApp is any application that is designed to run on a blockchain network, like Ethereum.


**DeepBrain Chain**
DeepBrain Chain is the first decentralized platform to provide a low-cost, private, flexible, safe, and decentralized artificial intelligence computing platform to artificial intelligence products. For more information, please visit [https://www.deepbrainchain.org/pc/en/index.html](https://www.deepbrainchain.org/pc/en/index.html).

**Ethereum** 
A decentralized platform for building applications based on smart contracts. Decentraland is being built on the Ethereum platform. For more information, please visit [https://www.ethereum.org](https://www.ethereum.org).


**ERC20 Token**
ERC20 is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for implementing tokens.


**One Game Token**
One Game Token (OGT) is an ERC20 compatible token initially issued on top of the Ethereum blockchain and then swapped to Deepbrain Chain token. There is a finite supply of OGT, and the amount in circulation will be pre-defined.

**Parcel**
A piece of virtual land with sizes ranging from 2K pixel*2K pixel to 2M pixel*2M pixel.

**Scene**
A scene within One Game comprises the 3D objects, textures, and audio content rendered on a parcel or group of parcels.

**Smart Contract**
A smart contract is simply a program on the Ethereum blockchain that facilitates and verifies digital transactions. Ethereum smart contracts enable developers to build decentralized applications that can track and transfer ownership of digital assets on a trustless network.
