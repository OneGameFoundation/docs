### Smart Contracts
--------------------

One Game’s core system is built on top of Deepbrain Chain, a low cost, decentralized artificial computing platform, as smart contracts.
One Game’s core system contains the following key components: 

- Miner’s Registration Center: where miners can register themselves, and service requests from the client side that are routed to the mining services.

- Incentive Program: manages how One Game token rewards are generated in the whole system, and how the rewards are distributed to miners, developers, and players.

- Land System: a decentralized ledger with full records of land creation, land ownership, and pricing history.

- Asset System: traces the status of all the game assets, such as the status of avatars. Every single asset in the world of One Game is non-fungible, and carries a unique id.
